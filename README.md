What is UUID?

A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a unique identifier used to identify information, objects, or entities.A UUID is a 128-bit (16-byte) hexadecimal number, usually separated into five parts by dashes, e.g.: xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx. where each x represents a hexadecimal number (0-9 and a-f), M represents the version number of the UUID, and N represents a variant of the UUID.

What are the characteristics of UUID?

Global uniqueness: The goal of a UUID is to ensure uniqueness globally, even though UUIDs generated at different computers and points in time should be different.

Randomness: UUIDs are usually generated based on random numbers to improve uniqueness.

No reliance on a central authority: Unlike some other unique identifiers (e.g., self-incrementing sequences or timestamps), UUIDs do not require a central authority to assign or manage them.

Multiple versions: There are different versions of UUIDs, each with different generation rules. The most common is version 4 (a random number based UUID).

Multiple Variants: There are also different variants of UUIDs, which are used to identify the encoding and representation of UUIDs.

UUIDs are widely used in computer systems, including databases, distributed systems, and network communications, to ensure uniqueness of identification. They are supported in many programming languages and platforms and are a commonly used identifier in distributed systems.
